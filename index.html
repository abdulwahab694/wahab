          <h1 align="center" >A journey to Malaysia</h1>
           <p>Malaysia was once ranked 9th in the world for tourist arrivals.
            [1] The Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2017 ranks
            Malaysia 25th out of 141 countries overall. In an effort to diversify
            the economy and make Malaysia's economy less dependent on exports,
            the government pushed to increase tourism in Malaysia. As a result, tourism
            has become Malaysia's third largest source of foreign exchange income,[2] and
            accounted for 7% of Malaysia's economy as of 2005.[3]</p>
