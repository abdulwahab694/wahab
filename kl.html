   <h1><center>A journey to Malaysia</center></h1>
  <div><center> Malaysia was once ranked 9th in the world for tourist arrivals.<br>
    [1] The Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2017 ranks<br>
     Malaysia 25th out of 141 countries overall.
In an effort to diversify<br> the economy and make Malaysia's economy less dependent on exports,
<br> the government pushed to increase tourism in Malaysia. As a result, tourism<br>
 has become Malaysia's third largest source of foreign exchange income,[2] and<br>
  accounted for 7% of Malaysia's economy as of 2005.[3]</center></div>

<center><h1>Population of Malaysia</h1></center>
<center><p>Early Kuala Lumpur was a small town that suffered from many social and political problems â€“ the<br>
   buildings were made of wood and atap (palm frond thatching) that were prone to fire, lack of proper<br>
    sanitation plagued the town with diseases, and it suffered from a constant threat of flooding.<br>
     The town became embroiled in the Selangor Civil War due in part to the fight for control of revenues<br>
      from the tin mines. The Chinese Kapitan Yap Ah Loy aligned himself with Tengku Kudin, and the<br>
       rival Chinese gang allied themselves with Raja Mahdi. Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa also switched side<br>
        to Raja Mahdi, and Kuala Lumpur was captured in 1872 and burnt to the ground. Yap escaped to <br>
        Klang where he reassembled a fighting force. Kuala Lumpur was recaptured by Yap in March 1873 <br>
        when Raja Mahdi forces were defeated with the help of fighters from Pahang</p></center>
